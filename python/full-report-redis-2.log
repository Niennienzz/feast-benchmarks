Note that these benchmarks were run with the version of Feast up to commit 23c09c83bc530de830ba867b10ceb02f113db5d6 on master (after v0.22, before v0.23). They were run with the Python HTTP server + Redis online store. The previous benchmarks for the Python HTTP server + Redis are located in full-report-redis.log, and are from an earlier version of Feast. In the future, these benchmarks should be run as part of tests on a scheduled basis.
